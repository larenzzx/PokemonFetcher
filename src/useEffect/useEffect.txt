useEffect - a react hook
          - lets you run code after the component renders

often use it to:
        - fetch api data
        - update the DOM
        - Set timers
        - listen for events

basic syntax

-> useEffect(() => {

}, []);

What is fetch and .then?
- fetch() gets data from api
- .then() waits for the response and processes it
